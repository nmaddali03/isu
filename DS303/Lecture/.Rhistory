## 1. This data set contains a few categorical predictors.
## Check that all the categorical predictors in our dataset are stored correctly using str()
## If they are not, fix it. Copy and paste your output here.
str(insurance)
insurance$gender <- factor(insurance$gender)
insurance$smoker <- as.factor(insurance$smoker)
insurance$region <- as.factor(insurance$region)
str(insurance)
## 2. Fit a model with the response (Y) as health care charges and predictors
## x_1 age, x2 = bmi, and x3 = gender.
## Based on your output, write out the fitted model for males only (gendermale = 1) and
## write out the fitted model for females only (gendermale = 0).
fit=lm(charges~age+bmi+gender,data=insurance)
summary(fit)
## 3. Your classmate tells you that including gender as a dummy variable in the model is not necessary.
## Instead you can just fit a model for males only and a separate model for females only.
## Your classmate claims this is approach is equivalent to what you did in part 2.
males=insurance[insurance$gender=="male",]
fit_males = lm(charges~bmi+age, data=males)
summary(fit_males)
females=insurance[insurance$gender=="female",]
fit_females = lm(charges~bmi+age, data=females)

## To see whether or not your classmate's approach makes sense,
## subset your data into two groups: data for males and data for females.
## Fit a model with bmi and age for the male group only. Call this model fit_males.
## Now do the same for the female group. Call this model fit_females.
## Based on your output, write out both model's estimated regression coefficients.
males=insurance[insurance$gender=="male",]
