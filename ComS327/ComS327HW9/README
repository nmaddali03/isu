Programming Project 1.09

Setup:
"make clean" to remove all generated files
"make" to compile code
"./poke327" to start the game

Pokemon Battle functionality implemented. The trainer starts with 10 pokeballs, potions and revives. 'B' to access the bag.
Revive/heal all pokemons for free at the PokeCenter. Restore all supplies in bag at the PokeMart.

Due to there being no PP or struggle, sometimes you can get stuck in an infinite battle if both your pokemon and the enemy
trainers pokemon have no damaging moves. To avoid this, make sure that when picking a starting pokemon, choose one with an 
attacking move, or catch a wild pokemon that has one before battling.

Move through tall grass to find wild pokemons.
